# Hello, everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/federicofusco/federicofusco/main/wave.gif" width="30px" />
My name is Federico Fusco and I'm a programmer. I currently live in Italy and started to code when I was 9 years old out of curiosity. I've participated in a couple of hackathons and I'm currently taking a robotics course at my high school.
